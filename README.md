============

Android application developed for my EL640 Mobile Application Design module during my final year at university.

The brief was to design and develop a mobile shopping application that allows users to shop for products on their Android smartphone. Users should be able to place mock orders - actual payment methods are not required.

The application was developed using the Android SDK with Eclipse, written in Java and XML.
